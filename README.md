# Description

The SailCam is an attempt to put an entirly self sufficent camera on a sail boat. The camera mounts to the stern rail of the boat and does not require an external power source. It powers itself entirely from solar energy and a battery pack.

The current design sacrifices elegance for modularity and brute force functionality. It is divided into components that can be individually detached and redesigned if needed. This allows for design iteration over a testing period. A new design will be created after core functionality is refined.

## Final Construction
Final Construction for the 2019 Mackinac Race. A lot of the chassis was 3D printed. Originally the camera module was designed to be in potrait mode, but after testing, it was changed to landscape.
